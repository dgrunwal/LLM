It's a powerful tool with applications across many industries, from art and design to software development and healthcare. \n","\n","You: summarize this output\n","Gemini: Okay, here's a summary of the previous explanation of Generative AI:\n","\n","Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence focused on **creating new, original content** (like text, images, audio, code, etc.). Unlike traditional AI that analyzes or predicts, it learns patterns from **massive datasets** to **generate novel outputs**. Its key characteristics are **creativity** and the ability to **learn from data**, essentially allowing machines to produce diverse content based on observed patterns. \n","\n","You: exit\n","Gemini Chatbot: Goodbye!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"NwkorD8W9vjU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
